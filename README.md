# ShopConverter
Minecraft plugin to transfer existing shops over to [Shop - a simple, intuitive shop plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/shop-a-simple-intuitive-shop-plugin.9628/)

This is a utility to convert all of your existing shops into Shop shops as easily as possible. No need to go remake all of your existing shops!

## Supported shops (so far)
- [ChestShop](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/chestshop/)
- [QuickShop](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/quickshop-reremake-1-17-ready-multi-currency.62575/)
- [Essentials](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/)


Don't see your shop plugin listed? Reach out to me in the **#shop** channel on [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/GpSwEWS) and I'm happy to look into adding it!

## How to use
Simply drop the this plugin in your plugins folder, then restart your server.
Make sure you have both Shop and the shop plugin you are converting from active on the server too! This will be automatically detected and there is no need for setup.

Once the shops are converted, feel free to remove this converter plugin along with the old shop plugin that you no longer need.


To convert your Shops, run the command /shopconvert
